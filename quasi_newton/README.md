#Quasi Newton

##1.Summary
    
    This algorithm cluster  is considered as the improvement of Newton algorithm. In order to solve problems as below,
    
    (1) The calculation of inverse matrix of hessen is too large.
    
    (2) It's hard to make sure the desent direction is always right
    
    Many algorithm is developed such as DFP correction algorithm , BFGS correction algorithm and L-BFGS correction algorithm.
    
    The core thinking is to find other way to simulate inverse matrix of hessen instead of directly calculating.
    
    And, in addtion, invite alpha to correct the desent direction.
